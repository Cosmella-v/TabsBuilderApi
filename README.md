# OutfitsPresets
- A mod that allows you to save outfits to switch them quickly
- you can find it in your inventory and or laptop in a lobby
- you can save and also delete presets ingame.

- Presets are saved at `%APPDATA%/../LocalLow/Innersloth/Among Us/OutfitPresets` so if you want to share them go here

- if for some reason you wanna make one without being ingame the json file is structured like this:
`{
"Hat" :"hatid",
"Visor" :"visorid",
"Skin" :"skinid",
"Color" :colorindex,
"Pet" :"petid"
}`
